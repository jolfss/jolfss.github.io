    **Hi! I'm Sean,** I recently joined [A10 Networks](https://www.a10networks.com/) to work on scaleable safety mechanisms for multimodal language models (MLLMs)! 🎉 


    I'm also a pianist/composer, hockey player, painter, graphic designer, fly-fisherman, Old Norse/Classical Latin poetry enthusiast, and soon-to-be figure skater.

    I graduated from [Cornell University](https://cis.cornell.edu/) ('25) with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I focused on graphics, computer vision, robotics, and agricultural technology. I was a member of [Prof. Donald Greenberg](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/donald-greenberg)'s lab and also his head TA for his course [*Visual Imaging in the Electronic Age*](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA24/class/CS/1620). I also TA'd for [*Deep Learning*](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4782/2025sp/) under Profs. Killian Weinberger and Jennifer Sun.
