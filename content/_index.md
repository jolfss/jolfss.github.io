    **Hi! I'm Sean**, I study Computer Science @ Cornell University. This page summarizes my undergraduate work in computer graphics/vision, robotics, and simulation.
    
    I'm also a pianist/composer, painter, hockey player, fly fisher, Old Norse/Latin poetry enthusiast, graphic designer, and soon-to-be figure skater!
