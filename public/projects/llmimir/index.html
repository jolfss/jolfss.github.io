##### Sean Brynjólfsson

Most people aren&#39;t aware that Icelandic is GPT-4&#39;s second language; but it is. What could this mean for its related, low-resource ancestor Old Norse?

Old Norse (often called Old Icelandic) is a language which is incredibly similar to modern Icelandic. For that reason, I was interested in investigating how trustworthy it might be for questions on Old Norse grammar and potentially for creative and academic/self-study uses. Would GPT-4 benefit from more exposure to Icelandic or would that bleed into its understanding of Old Norse?

This paper examines GPT-4 on all Old Norse verbs and their verb forms. The experiment was conducted at a temperature of 0 (since I could not afford to sample multiple responses per form) and with a blank context. This scenario should be nearly deterministic and yield low variance responses.
