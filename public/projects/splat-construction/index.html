##### Sean BrynjÃ³lfsson\*, Dyllan Hofflich\*, Evan Zhang\*, Daniel Qureshi\*, Natalie Leung\*

We investigate the potential applications of gaussian splatting on construction sites to capture a holsitic digital twin throughout the construction process via legged robots. This project was our collective introduction to gaussian splatting, so a large portion of it is dedicated to a review of currently existing methods. This was a great experience even though we did not acheive our goals.

We used NVIDIA Omniverse to model our simulated environment and an ANYmal-D equipped with a RGBD camera. One part of our team worked with the Blender-to-Omniverse connector to try and get realistic construction environs for us to simulate.
